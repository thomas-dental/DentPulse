-- Fix chart_get_production_metrics: "Other" provider type was returning all providers.
--
-- "Other" means providers whose role is NOT Dentist / Hygienist / Therapist.
-- When p_provider_type = 'Other': exclude known dentist/hygienist/therapist roles.
-- All other values use the existing ILIKE match as before.
--
-- Also consolidates all previous fixes (location filter, days_worked precision).
