-- Fix appointment_summary trigger: remove apmt_patient_id IS NOT NULL filter.
--
-- Problem: Dentally stores blocked/reserved appointment slots with patient_id = null.
-- These are real working time (e.g. admin blocks, reserved slots) that appear in
-- Dentally's "Total hours" report. DentPulse was excluding them, causing a ~1-2h
-- undercount per provider per month (especially visible in multi-location accounts).
--
-- Ghost/stale records are already filtered by:
--   - apmt_duration IS NOT NULL  (no duration = not a real appointment)
--   - apmt_start_time IS NOT NULL (no start time = not a real appointment)
--   - deleted_at IS NULL
-- so removing the patient_id filter is safe.
